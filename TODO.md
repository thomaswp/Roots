Plans: 
* Add a diagram to the tutorial to explain mechanics: Add text/icons and a better icon, scale properly
* Make a better text box for join link.
* Sounds for unlocking, activating, error and winning
* Victory!

Suggestions:
* Add more co-op interactivity (e.g., marking goals, celebrating unlocks)
* Rework level generators to have a more even difficulty curve (e.g. cap at 4 stones?)
